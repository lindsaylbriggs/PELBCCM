Submit a link to your group project code on github. I am expecting functions with docstrings and at least 5 examples of unit tests of those functions. The tested functions do not have to be overly complicated, but you should be able to tell me, in the code, what acceptance criteria (from your requirements document) is being met by this successful test.



Your "README" file should include your project summary, fixed rough draft, and a description of the notebooks or python scripts that are included on your github page. You can use this page as an example: SVRIMG/README.md at master 路 ahaberlie/SVRIMG 路 GitHub. If you click on "raw", it will show you the markdown code and how to embed images, make headers, etc. You can copy and paste aspects of this readme and modify the text and use your own figures / demonstration pictures (I would suggest making an 'img' folder in your github project: SVRIMG/img at master 路 ahaberlie/SVRIMG 路 GitHub).
