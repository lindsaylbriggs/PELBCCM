Submit a link to your group project code on github. I am expecting functions with docstrings and at least 5 examples of unit tests of those functions. The tested functions do not have to be overly complicated, but you should be able to tell me, in the code, what acceptance criteria (from your requirements document) is being met by this successful test.



Your "README" file should include your project summary, fixed rough draft, and a description of the notebooks or python scripts that are included on your github page. You can use this page as an example: SVRIMG/README.md at master 路 ahaberlie/SVRIMG 路 GitHub. If you click on "raw", it will show you the markdown code and how to embed images, make headers, etc. You can copy and paste aspects of this readme and modify the text and use your own figures / demonstration pictures (I would suggest making an 'img' folder in your github project: SVRIMG/img at master 路 ahaberlie/SVRIMG 路 GitHub).

## 1. Introduction and Background 


This cloud classification machine learning model was developed as a part of the EAE 495: Data 
Science for the Geosciences course at Northern Illinois University under Dr. Alex Haberlie. In 
atmospheric science and meteorology alike, clouds have a significant influence on temperature 
and are the source of precipitation (i.e. rain, snow, hail). Clouds give vital insight to forecasters 
and weather scientists of current conditions in the atmosphere. Identifying cloud types via 
satellite can provide another method of estimating rainfall rates.

Clouds and their classifications

Insert table here 

Clouds are classified by height and shape. There are ten basic cloud types that are categorized 
into three subclassifications based on their heights. 


The aim of this machine learner is not to predict the severity or convective mode produced, but 
rather to identify the type of cloud depicted in satellite imagery. Machine learning can be trained to recognize cloud types from different sources such as ground 
based image observations from the surface, satellite imagery and climate models. An issue with 
ground-based imagery is that this method would not be as effective at night due to photos losing 
contrast during nighttime. This is where our second and third methods come into play. By 
training the CCM on satellite imagery, a product such as Long Wave Infrared, clouds would be 
able to be depicted after nightfall to allow our model to function during dark hours.
